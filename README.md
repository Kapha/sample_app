#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is a post office application that is built off the the sample application for 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com)

I am deeply indebted to Mr. Hartl for the back end that helps run this program 
and will be using his work as a cornerstone for the rest of this program.

Things I have added/hope to add.

Branding for U 31
A working Admin assignment process.
A mobile version for smart phone users.
Password reset function
Private messaging
Search for users
